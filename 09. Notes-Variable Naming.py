Notes: Variable Naming

-               Variables always need a Name. Something that is recognizable. "user_name" would be agood variable 
                name for a Username Variable. "user name" would process a Error since is not allowed to use
                spaces in Variable Names. 
                
Example:        user name = user_name
                car list = car_list
                bike parts = bike_parts
                
                Remember Variable Name are Case Sensitive and need to be correct. 
                We can't have a list called "names" and then print a list called "namas". This will only work if 
                there is a list called "namas". Name Errors mostly come from spell errors. 
                
-               Numbers in variable names are ok. But you we not allowed to use the Number at the bekginning
                of the Variable name. "1length" would not be ok but "length1" would be ok. 
              
    Example:    user name 1 = user_name1
                car list 1 = car_list1
                bike parts 1 = bike_parts1
                
-               Privileged Words like "print or "input" should not be used as Vartiable Names.
