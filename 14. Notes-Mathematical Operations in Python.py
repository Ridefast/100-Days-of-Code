Notes: Mathematical Operations in Python

Mathematical Operators in Python:

Addition (+) -  2+2=4
Division (/) - Result in Python is always a float Number 10/2=5
Multiplication (*) - 2*3=6
Exponentiation (**) - 2**3 = 2*2=4*2=8

PEMDAS+Left to right

1. P  -  Parentheses (), then
2. E  -  Exponents ** , then
3. MD -  Multiplication * and division 
4. AS -  Addition +  and subtraction
5. Left to right 

Example: print(3*3+3/3-3) = 7

Reason:     3*3 = 9 
            3/3 = 1
            9+1 = 10
            10-3 = 7

Exercise: Change the Code that it prints out "3"
Code:     print(2*5+3/3-8)
Reason:   2*5 = 10 +
          3/3 = 1 = 11
          11-8 = 3
          
By setting () it's possible to prioritize Calculaltions since anything in () has a higher Priority. 

Function:   round(number, digits)
Example:    x=round(5.2452 ,2) = We round the Number "5.2452" to two digits
Reason:     The round() function returns a floating point number that is a rounded version 
            of the specified number, with the specified number of decimals.
            The default number of decimals is 0, meaning that the function will return the
            nearest integer.
