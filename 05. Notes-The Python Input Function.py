Notes: The Python Input Funtion

-   Input Function = A prompt for the User 
    Example:    input("What is your Name")
    Output:     What is your name - and then the Programm waits for a User Input. That can be 
                recognized because there is cursor that sometimes is blinking
            
-   What can we do with that Input 
    Example:    print("Hello" + input("What is your Name"))
    Output:     What is your name - Then the User makes a Input in our Case Angela
                After the User Input the "Hello" turns to the User Input in this Case Angela
    Output:     HelloHans

-   The "#" Sign = Is used the Comment Code and     will not be taken into account by the programm
    Example:    #this is the comment
                print("Hello")
    Output:     Hello
