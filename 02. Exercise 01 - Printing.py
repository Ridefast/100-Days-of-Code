Exercise Code:
print("Day 1 - Python Print Function")
print("The function is declared like this:")
print("print('what to print'")

Output: 
Day 1 - Python Print Function
The function is declared like this:
print('what to print')

Notes: 
-   It doesnt matter if we set a "" or ''. The problem is that if we want to put output in ""
    we can not use "".
    
    Wrong Line: print("print('what to print")")
    
    Reason:     -("print("- = String
                -what to print- = Code
                -")")- =String
    
    So when we want to use some double quotes inside another set of double quotes, use single quotes
    
    Examples: print('!¿!'), print('"¿"') , print('"bla bla"')
