Notes: String Manipulation and Code Intelligence

-   A New Line ist made with "\n"
    Example:    print("Hello World\nHello World")
    Output:     Hello World
                Hello World
    
    This can also be used to write different Text
    Example:    print("Hello Santiago\nHow are you doing\nOn this nice Day")
    Output:     Hello Santiago
                How are you doing
                On this nice Day
